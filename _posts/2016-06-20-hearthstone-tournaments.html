title: Hearthstone Tournaments via Battlefy

<h5>Battlefy Shoutout</h5>
<p>I discovered this great web app called Battlefy while watching a Hearthstone podcast called "The Angry Chicken". It makes tournament set up and organization a breeze. This will allow me to run tournaments more frequently. As such...</p>

<h5>June Tournament Status</h5>
<p>This tournament is almost done. We are now down to the Loser Bracket Finals feature Alkrym vs Jonstrange. The winner will go on to the grand finals to play our defending champion Dragonheart.

<h5>July Tournament Status</h5>
<p>I've gone ahead and opened up July's registration. The rules for this tournament are slightly different so please be sure to read the rules. You'll find a contact e-mail on the battlefy page if you have any questions.

<h5>Site Changes</h5>
<p>I'd like to point out that I've added a link to a <a href="/calendar">google calendar</a> that will allow you to view guild events outside of WoW. It's not 100% streamlined as I can't access the guild calendar outside of the game but a few people have edit permissions on the calendar which will allow us to keep it updated. The calendar will also contain any interesting non-WoW events.</p>
